(ns kotoba.ip.resources
  "EDN resource loader for `kotoba.ip` constant/config resources.

  Mirrors the loader pattern in `kami-scene-contracts`
  (`kami.scene.contracts/load-edn-resource`). This file is JVM-only
  (plain `.clj`, not `.cljc`) since `clojure.java.io/resource` + `slurp`
  are not portable to ClojureScript — matching the `kotoba-lang/fea`
  precedent (`kotoba.fea.material-loader`) of keeping resource-IO helpers
  in a dedicated `.clj` file rather than reader-conditional-guarding an
  otherwise-empty `.cljc` namespace.

  The pure `.cljc` domain namespaces (`kotoba.ip.bus-protocol`,
  `kotoba.ip.noc`, ...) keep their constants embedded as plain Clojure data
  so they stay usable without resource IO on every platform. The EDN files
  under `resources/kotoba/ip/` are the canonical, diff-able,
  tooling-friendly source of truth for those constants; a round-trip test
  in `test/` asserts the embedded data matches the resource exactly, so the
  two can never silently drift.

  As of 2026-07-10 the on-disk EDN resources are Datomic/Datascript
  tx-data (`[{:db/id -1 <ns>/<key> <value> ...}]`, see `/schema.edn` and
  `edn-datomize.bb`) rather than a bare top-level map, so they stay
  queryable by generic EDN/Datomic tooling. `load-edn` reconstitutes the
  original bare map (stripping the file-level namespace and un-blobbing
  any `pr-str`'d nested values) so every existing caller — including the
  round-trip tests above — keeps working unchanged."
